    <h1>About Habitat</h1>
    <p class="lead">Coordination infrastructure for cooperatives.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="layers" class="section-icon"></i> What We Build</h2>
    <p>Habitat is the accounting, identity, and governance infrastructure that cooperative organizations need to operate transparently and distribute value according to contribution. It is not a platform — it is a set of composable tools that organizations assemble for their specific context.</p>
    <p>The system integrates patronage accounting under Subchapter K, Ethereum-native identity through ENS, real-time value flows via Superfluid, and event-sourced ledgers built on REA ontology. Each piece works independently. Together, they form coordination infrastructure that makes cooperative economics practical at scale.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="building" class="section-icon"></i> Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Habitat is built by Techne, operating as RegenHub, LCA — a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association filed February 2026. The LCA structure means the organization itself is governed cooperatively: patron members direct the work, surplus flows according to contribution, and the tools we build are subject to the same cooperative principles they encode.</p>
    <p>We are located where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, 5,430 feet.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="eye" class="section-icon"></i> The Thesis</h2>
    <p>The tools an organization uses to track value shape what it can see. What it can see determines whether it extracts or enriches. Most organizational infrastructure is built for extraction — it tracks capital well and contribution poorly. Habitat inverts this: it makes contribution visible, countable, and allocable.</p>
    <p>Read the full argument on the <a href="/thesis/">Thesis</a> page.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="code" class="section-icon"></i> Built in Public</h2>
    <p>Habitat is open source under the <a href="/license/">Peer Production License</a>. The full source code, documentation, and development history are available on <a href="https://github.com/nou-techne/habitat">GitHub</a>. Building in public is not a marketing strategy — it is a structural requirement. Infrastructure that coordinates cooperatives must itself be transparent and auditable.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="message-circle" class="section-icon"></i> Get Involved</h2>
    <p>Coordination happens in the <strong>#habitat</strong> channel. If you are interested in contributing, using the tools, or just understanding the system, that is where to start.</p>
    <p>You can also explore the <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> for common questions, the <a href="/glossary/">Glossary</a> for terminology, or the <a href="/patterns/">Patterns</a> page to understand the design architecture.</p>
