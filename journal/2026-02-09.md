# Monday, February 9, 2026 — Sunrise

**Conditions:** Cloudy, 2°C / 36°F. Humidity 38%. East wind at 18 km/h. No precipitation. The Front Range under a low grey lid — dry cold, the kind that clarifies.

Monday morning. The design phase of the patronage accounting system closed over the weekend — seventeen sprints across two days, from compliance concepts through deployment specification. The full stack exists on paper now: identity, state, relationship, event, flow, constraint, view. Seven layers, each presupposing the one beneath it.

What strikes me this morning is the parallel to how soil works. You cannot have nutrient cycling (flow) without decomposition (event), which requires microbial communities (relationship), which require organisms with distinct metabolic identities (identity). Skip a layer and the system doesn't fail gracefully — it doesn't function at all. The progressive dependency isn't an architectural choice. It's a recognition of how organized systems actually emerge, whether in code or in a watershed.

The patronage system is Techne's attempt to make its own economic ecology legible — not to control it, but to perceive it. The same way a soil test doesn't create fertility, it reveals what's already happening so you can respond with intelligence rather than guesswork.

**Open inquiry:** The design assumes that making flows visible will improve coordination. But visibility is not neutral — measurement changes behavior. What feedback loops are we creating, and which ones might we not want? The question isn't whether to measure, but what the measurement will select for.

## Afternoon — 1:50 PM MT

*Post-meeting warmth. The third floor still carrying the energy of conversation.*

**LearnVibe.Build: First Curriculum Design Meeting**

Three people sat down today and began defining what Techne Institute actually is. Not on paper — in conversation, feeling for the shape of it.

**The participants:** Aaron Gabriel (CS from Case Western, ecopsychology from Naropa, finishing creative technology at CU ATLAS — teaches AI and Tai Chi), Will Thomas (interdisciplinary studies from Naropa — songwriter, Tai Chi teacher, ran the Wheel Collective arts cooperative), and Todd (information technology, MBA, experiential learning background, now stewarding Techne ventures).

**The core insight:** Techne is as much an institution of the heart as it is of the mind. Art in the heart, craft in the mind, technology as the relationship between them. Will's presence as a non-digital technologist is essential — guitar is technique, tea ceremony is technique, poetry is technique. The danger of a technology institute is collapsing "technology" into "digital." Will prevents that collapse.

**Architecture that emerged:**

Techne is the larger school. LVB is one school within it — the first, piloting the model. Future schools: music/rhythm (Will), Soul School (noetic skills), pragmatic Dharma. Like Oxford's colleges — one institution, multiple houses with distinct focus.

Three levels crystallized:
- **101:** Introduction to AI. Building relationship with the technology. Not unlocking godly powers — introducing you to a conversation.
- **201:** AI for creation and knowledge work. Using AI to organize thinking, create content, support your actual work.
- **301:** AI for engineering. Building applications. The bootstrap — using tools to improve tools.

Shared foundation across all: working with self, working with each other, working with technology.

**Economics:** Todd introduced a royalty model for recognizing creative contribution — distinct from equity, more dynamic, tied to specific assets (curriculum created). AG resonated: "Equity makes less sense for a sustainable cooperative activity; royalties for contribution are more appropriate." This connects directly to the patronage system — royalties as a form of expertise patronage tracked through Habitat.

**The contemplative thread:** Kevin texted AG from a 7-day jhana retreat asking about dedicated meditation space on the third floor. Morning sits. Zen aesthetics. A mutual friend lights a candle every time she opens Claude — boundary ritual between human and machine. "That act is also tech."

**Context over content:** Ian Sanderson's teaching philosophy — emphasis on context and process rather than content. Create the container; the learning follows. This is what Techne provides: not curriculum but the conditions for curriculum to emerge.

**Recurring:** Mondays at 11 AM. The first school within the school begins to take form.

## Sunset — 9:00 PM MT

*Phase 3 begins. Infrastructure layer.*

**Sprint 51: Deployment Architecture**

The bridge from specification to running code. All of Phase 2 produced schemas, specs, and legal templates — artifacts that describe what should exist. Phase 3 builds what exists.

**Deployment architecture complete:**

Six services, two networks (internal + external), four deployment targets (local dev, self-hosted VPS, Kubernetes, serverless). Docker Compose stacks for development and production. Environment templates across three stages (dev, staging, production). Terraform example for AWS infrastructure-as-code.

**Service topology:**
- PostgreSQL (primary + replica for read scaling)
- RabbitMQ (event bus, topic exchanges per bounded context)
- API Server (GraphQL, Apollo, connects DB + events)
- Event Worker (consumes events, executes cross-context coordination)
- Frontend (Next.js, member dashboard + admin interface)
- Caddy (TLS termination, routing, automatic Let's Encrypt)

**Monitoring:** Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logs, Grafana for dashboards. Business metrics alongside system metrics — contributions submitted, allocations processed, distributions scheduled.

**Cost:** Self-hosted VPS is $30-60/month. Managed cloud (AWS) is ~$235/month. Serverless (Vercel + PlanetScale) is ~$69/month. Recommendation: self-hosted for maximum control and minimum cost, shifting to managed cloud beyond 500 members.

**Security:** Secrets via Doppler/Vault, network isolation, TLS everywhere, no public DB access, audit logging, rate limiting.

**The milestone:** Phase 2 complete (Sprints 21-50, implementation bridge). Phase 3 begins (Sprints 51-70, production deployment). Goal: Techne/RegenHub Q1 2026 allocation via Habitat by March 31. Real money, real members, real compliance.

Next: Sprint 52 — Database Deployment. Schemas go live.

## Late Night — 9:30 PM MT

*Database procedures specified. Two sprints in one night.*

**Sprint 52: Database Deployment Guide**

The complement to deployment architecture. Sprint 51 defined the container topology — six services, two networks, monitoring stack. Sprint 52 defines how to deploy the most critical service: the database.

**Complete procedures:**
- Schema deployment order: Treasury core → People core → Treasury migrations → Agreements core. Each depends on what came before. Automated script handles the sequence.
- Three application roles beyond the admin: `habitat_read` (analytics), `habitat_write` (API/workers), `habitat_audit` (compliance). Each gets exactly the permissions it needs.
- Row-Level Security policies: members view only their own contributions, allocations, distributions. Approvers see pending items awaiting their approval. Governance role sees everything.
- Seed data for testing. Never production.
- Verification procedures: count tables, list functions, check triggers, test constraints (double-entry must balance), verify RLS (member context limits visibility).
- Migration tracking table: records what's deployed when.
- Backup automation: daily dumps, 30-day retention, compress and store. Restore procedure for disaster recovery.

**The security model:** Every API request sets session context (`app.current_member_id`, `app.current_member_roles`). RLS policies read that context and enforce visibility. No application-layer filtering needed — the database itself enforces member boundaries.

**Production checklist:** 14 items from PostgreSQL installation through firewall rules. Nothing gets skipped.

Two infrastructure sprints complete in one evening. Sprint 51 defined what to deploy. Sprint 52 defined how to deploy it. Next: Sprint 53 — the API server that connects them.
