## Article [X]: Patronage Accounting and Allocation

### Section [X].1 — Patronage Defined

**Patronage** means the business that a Member conducts with or for the Cooperative during an Accounting Period, measured in accordance with this Article. Patronage shall be classified and valued as follows:

#### (a) Labor Patronage
Labor Patronage means hours of work performed by a Member on behalf of the Cooperative, valued at the Member's approved hourly rate as established by [governance body] and recorded in the Cooperative's People system.

Labor Patronage shall include:
- Direct service delivery to the Cooperative's ventures or clients
- Administrative and operational work for the Cooperative
- Governance participation (board service, committee work)
- Community building and member engagement activities
- Infrastructure development and maintenance

Labor hours shall be logged in the Cooperative's time-tracking system and approved by [designated approver] before being recorded as Patronage.

#### (b) Expertise Patronage
Expertise Patronage means specialized knowledge or professional services contributed by a Member that provide extraordinary value beyond standard labor rates, including but not limited to:
- Legal or compliance review
- Financial modeling or tax strategy
- System architecture or technical design
- Strategic planning or business development
- Specialized domain expertise critical to the Cooperative's mission

Expertise Patronage shall be valued at rates negotiated between the Member and [governance body] based on market comparables and the value delivered to the Cooperative.

#### (c) Capital Patronage
Capital Patronage means financial resources contributed by a Member to the Cooperative, including:
- Cash contributions to the Cooperative's Treasury
- Property contributions (equipment, intellectual property, real estate)
- Loans to the Cooperative at approved interest rates
- Guarantees of Cooperative obligations

Capital Patronage shall be valued at:
- Cash: face value of contribution
- Property: fair market value at contribution date, established by [appraisal method]
- Loans: principal amount outstanding during the Accounting Period
- Guarantees: [percentage] of guaranteed amount per annum

#### (d) Relationship Patronage
Relationship Patronage means business relationships or revenue opportunities a Member brings to the Cooperative, including:
- Client referrals resulting in executed contracts
- Partnership opportunities generating revenue
- Grant opportunities secured through the Member's network
- Vendor relationships reducing Cooperative expenses

Relationship Patronage shall be valued at [percentage]% of revenue generated or costs saved during the Accounting Period, as approved by [governance body].

### Section [X].2 — Accounting Periods

The Cooperative shall maintain an **Accounting Period** structure as follows:

#### (a) Period Types
The Cooperative may establish multiple Accounting Period types:
- **Fiscal Periods** — aligned with the Cooperative's tax year [calendar/fiscal year ending MM/DD]
- **Operational Periods** — monthly, quarterly, or other intervals established by [governance body] for management purposes

#### (b) Period Status
Each Accounting Period shall have a status:
- **Open** — Patronage contributions may be recorded; transactions may be posted
- **Pending Close** — No new Patronage may be recorded; final reconciliation in progress
- **Closed** — Patronage allocation calculated and locked; no further modifications permitted except by formal amendment under Section [X].8

#### (c) Period Close Procedures
At the end of each Accounting Period, [designated officer] shall:
1. Verify all Patronage contributions have been recorded and approved
2. Calculate Patronage Allocations under Section [X].4
3. Generate allocation statements for each Member
4. Present allocations to [governance body] for approval
5. Update Member Capital Accounts under Section [X].5
6. Close the period and lock the records

### Section [X].3 — Patronage Weighting

Not all Patronage types contribute equally to the Cooperative's surplus generation. The Cooperative shall establish **Patronage Weights** reflecting the relative value of each Patronage type to surplus creation.

#### (a) Default Weights
Unless otherwise established by [governance body], Patronage Weights shall be:
- Labor Patronage: 1.0× (baseline)
- Expertise Patronage: 1.5× (reflects specialized value)
- Capital Patronage: 0.5× (reflects lower liquidity risk compared to labor)
- Relationship Patronage: 1.0× (baseline)

#### (b) Weight Adjustments
[Governance body] may adjust Patronage Weights on a per-Period basis to reflect:
- Strategic priorities (e.g., increasing capital weight to encourage funding)
- Market conditions (e.g., adjusting expertise weight for scarce skills)
- Cooperative stage (e.g., higher relationship weight during growth phase)

Weight adjustments must be established before the Accounting Period begins and shall apply uniformly to all Members within a Patronage class.

#### (c) Weighted Patronage Calculation
For each Member, **Weighted Patronage** shall be calculated as:

```
Weighted Patronage = Σ (Patronage Value × Patronage Weight)
```

Where the sum runs over all Patronage types contributed by the Member during the Accounting Period.

### Section [X].4 — Patronage Allocation Formula

At the close of each Accounting Period, **Allocable Surplus** (or loss) shall be distributed to Members in proportion to their Weighted Patronage.

#### (a) Allocable Surplus Defined
**Allocable Surplus** means the Cooperative's net income for the Accounting Period, as determined under [GAAP/tax accounting], after:
- Establishing or replenishing reserves as required by [Article/Section on reserves]
- Allocating any amounts to collective funds (education, community grants, infrastructure)
- Satisfying any minimum capital requirements under [Article/Section on capital]

#### (b) Allocation Formula
Each Member's **Patronage Allocation** shall be:

```
Member Allocation = (Member Weighted Patronage / Total Weighted Patronage) × Allocable Surplus
```

Where:
- **Member Weighted Patronage** = the Member's total weighted Patronage for the period
- **Total Weighted Patronage** = sum of all Members' weighted Patronage for the period
- **Allocable Surplus** = surplus available for distribution after reserves and collective allocations

#### (c) Loss Allocation
If the Cooperative generates a loss for the Accounting Period, the loss shall be allocated using the same formula. Member Capital Account balances shall be reduced accordingly.

#### (d) Patronage Allocation Statements
Within [30/60/90] days of Period Close, each Member shall receive a Patronage Allocation statement showing:
- Total Patronage contributed by type (Labor, Expertise, Capital, Relationship)
- Weighted Patronage calculation
- Member's share of Allocable Surplus
- Distribution between cash and retained allocations (Section [X].6)
- Updated Capital Account balance

### Section [X].5 — Member Capital Accounts

The Cooperative shall maintain a **Capital Account** for each Member tracking:
- Initial capital contributions
- Patronage Allocations from closed Accounting Periods
- Cash distributions paid to the Member
- Member's share of Cooperative liabilities (for tax purposes)

#### (a) Capital Account Structure
Capital Accounts shall be maintained in accordance with IRC Section 704(b) and Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b), ensuring:
- Allocations have substantial economic effect
- Capital Accounts reflect Member's economic interest in the Cooperative
- Deficit restoration obligations (if any) are clearly documented

#### (b) Book vs. Tax Accounting
The Cooperative shall maintain separate **Book Capital Accounts** (reflecting GAAP or operational accounting) and **Tax Capital Accounts** (reflecting IRC Section 704(b) requirements). 

When property is contributed to the Cooperative, the difference between the property's book value and tax basis shall be tracked in a **704(c) Layer** associated with the contributing Member's Capital Account.

#### (c) Capital Account Statements
Members shall receive Capital Account statements [annually/quarterly] showing:
- Beginning balance
- Patronage Allocations during the period
- Cash distributions during the period
- Share of Cooperative income, gains, losses, deductions (for tax purposes)
- Ending balance

### Section [X].6 — Qualified Allocations and Distributions

Patronage Allocations may be distributed in **cash**, **retained** as equity in the Cooperative, or a combination thereof, subject to IRS requirements for **Qualified Written Notices of Allocation** under IRC Section 1385.

#### (a) Distribution Ratio
Unless otherwise determined by [governance body], Patronage Allocations shall be distributed:
- [20%] in cash
- [80%] retained as equity (Qualified Written Notice of Allocation)

The cash portion satisfies the minimum distribution requirement under IRC Section 1385(b)(1) for the retained portion to be deductible by the Cooperative.

#### (b) Qualified Written Notice Requirements
For retained allocations to qualify as **Qualified Written Notices of Allocation**, the Cooperative shall:
- Distribute at least 20% of the allocation in cash
- Provide written notice to the Member within [statutory timeframe]
- State the dollar amount of the allocation and the portion distributed in cash
- Inform the Member that the retained amount is taxable income in the year of allocation

#### (c) Consent to Include Allocations in Income
By executing this Operating Agreement, each Member consents to include Qualified Written Notices of Allocation in gross income in the year of allocation, as required by IRC Section 1385(a).

### Section [X].7 — Redemption of Retained Patronage

Retained Patronage Allocations represent Member equity in the Cooperative and may be redeemed according to the Cooperative's **Equity Redemption Policy**, established by [governance body].

#### (a) Redemption Timing
The Cooperative may establish redemption on a:
- **Revolving basis** — oldest allocations redeemed first when surplus allows
- **Fixed-term basis** — allocations redeemed [X] years after allocation
- **Discretionary basis** — redemptions approved annually by [governance body] based on liquidity

#### (b) Redemption Priority
If the Cooperative's liquidity limits full redemption, redemptions shall be prioritized:
1. Members who have left the Cooperative
2. Hardship requests approved by [governance body]
3. Pro-rata redemption of oldest allocations among active Members

#### (c) No Guaranteed Redemption
Members acknowledge that retained allocations are equity, not debt, and the Cooperative has no obligation to redeem them on any specific timeline. Redemption is contingent on Cooperative surplus and liquidity.

### Section [X].8 — Amendments and Corrections

If an error is discovered in Patronage recording or allocation calculations after Period Close, [governance body] may approve amendments subject to the following constraints:

#### (a) Material vs. Immaterial Errors
- **Immaterial errors** (less than [1%] of total allocations or [$X] absolute): may be corrected in the current period
- **Material errors**: require formal amendment of the closed period, reissuance of allocation statements, and amended tax reporting if applicable

#### (b) Statute of Limitations
Amendments to closed periods shall not be permitted more than [3 years] after Period Close, consistent with IRS statute of limitations for amended tax returns.

#### (c) Member Notification
All Members affected by an amendment shall receive written notice describing:
- Nature of the error
- Impact on their allocation
- Revised Capital Account balance
- Tax reporting implications (if any)

### Section [X].9 — Integration with Habitat Infrastructure

The Cooperative utilizes the **Habitat Patronage Accounting System** to implement the mechanics described in this Article. Habitat provides:
- Event-sourced transaction log for audit trail and compliance verification
- Automated calculation of Weighted Patronage and allocation formulas
- Capital Account tracking compliant with IRC Section 704(b)
- Integration with the Cooperative's Treasury, People, and Agreements systems

Members acknowledge that Habitat's automated calculations are binding, subject to the amendment procedures in Section [X].8.
