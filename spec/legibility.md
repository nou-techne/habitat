# Organizational Legibility as Product

## The Problem

Organizations — especially cooperatives and multi-stakeholder entities — face an ongoing operational requirement: making their internal activity legible to members, investors, regulators, and the public.

Who contributed what? How does value flow? What does each party own? How are decisions made?

Most solve this with spreadsheets, lawyers, and accountants working in isolation. The result is expensive, opaque, and fragile. Legibility decays the moment the document is produced.

## The Insight

What if the tools built to make one organization legible became products other organizations can use?

**Treasury** tracks value flows. Capital accounts, transactions, balances. Works for a freelancer tracking income or a cooperative tracking member equity.

**People** tracks contributors and their stakes. Who did what, what do they hold, how does contribution translate to ownership.

**Agreements** encodes relationships. Allocation formulas, distribution rules, governance terms. The operating agreement becomes executable, not just a PDF.

Each tool is small enough to build in a sprint. Each works independently. Together they compose into the operational backbone any organization needs.

## Legibility as Default State

Without tools: legibility requires repeated explanation, custom spreadsheets, manual reconciliation, professional hours.

With tools: legibility is the default state. The system surfaces what matters. Updates happen as events occur. External parties can review directly.

The success metric is not "features shipped" — it is "can someone outside the organization understand what's happening inside it, without being told?"

## Economics

If portfolio organizations use the tools, the entity providing them gains visibility into operations it supports. Better insight enables better support. The tools become infrastructure for coordination, not just accounting.

Conservative estimate for SaaS: 200 organizations at $100/month average = $240K annual revenue. Small but real — enough to cover operational costs and demonstrate sustainability. More interesting is the network effect: every organization using the tools makes their operations legible in the same grammar, enabling comparison, coordination, and trust across entities.
