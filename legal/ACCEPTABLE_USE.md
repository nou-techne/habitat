# Acceptable Use Policy

**RegenHub, LCA** · DBA Techne Institute
A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association · Boulder, Colorado

*Effective February 11, 2026*

---

This Acceptable Use Policy covers the products, services, and technologies (collectively referred to as the "Products") provided by RegenHub, LCA under any ongoing agreement. It's designed to protect our cooperative, our members, and the broader commons from unethical, irresponsible, and illegal activity.

As a cooperative, we ground this policy in **mutual respect and commons stewardship**. We're building something together — a shared knowledge commons, a democratic economic institution, and a learning community. This policy reflects the trust and responsibility that comes with that shared endeavor.

RegenHub, LCA members and users found engaging in activities prohibited by this policy may be subject to service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to report such activity to the relevant authorities.

## Cooperative Principles in Practice

Our acceptable use expectations flow from the [Cooperative Principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity):

- **Voluntary and open membership** — Our platforms are welcoming spaces
- **Democratic member control** — Respect democratic processes and decisions
- **Member economic participation** — Use patronage systems honestly and in good faith
- **Autonomy and independence** — Don't compromise the cooperative's independence
- **Education and training** — Contribute to shared learning, not misinformation
- **Cooperation among cooperatives** — Treat partner cooperatives and their members with respect
- **Concern for community** — Consider the impact of your actions on others

## Fair Use

We provide our services with the assumption your use will be consistent with normal cooperative participation. If your use is considered excessive or places undue burden on shared infrastructure, we may work with you to find a sustainable arrangement. We believe in dialogue before enforcement.

We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement, and any action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual, or resource. We expect our members, users, and their end-users to engage our Products with similar intent.

## Member and User Accountability

We regard our members and users as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the actions of anyone using our Products with their permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone using our Products on an unauthorized basis as a result of a user's failure to put in place reasonable security measures.

By using our Products, you agree to ensure adherence to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Products as your end users. Complaints regarding the actions of users or their end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question.

If a user — or anyone using our Products through their account — violates this acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Products associated with the offending account or the account itself, or take any remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate. We will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the user before taking action, except where immediate action is necessary to protect the cooperative or its members.

## Prohibited Activity

### Copyright Infringement and Unauthorized Material

Our Products must not be used to transmit, distribute, or store any material in violation of any applicable law. This includes but isn't limited to:

- Any material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization
- Any material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws

You are solely responsible for all material you input, upload, disseminate, transmit, create, or publish through our Products, and for obtaining legal permission to use any works included in such material.

**A note on copyleft:** We encourage sharing and remixing under appropriate open licenses. Our concern is with unauthorized use of *others'* proprietary material, not with legitimate open-source and commons-based production.

### Spam and Unauthorized Messaging

Our Products must not be used for the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk or commercial messages in violation of applicable laws ("spam"). This includes but isn't limited to sending spam, soliciting from spam sent from other providers, and collecting replies to spam sent from other providers.

### Harassment and Harmful Behavior

Our Products must not be used to:

- Harass, bully, intimidate, or threaten any individual or group
- Publish or share others' private information without consent (doxxing)
- Engage in hate speech or discriminatory behavior based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other protected characteristic
- Stalk or persistently contact someone who has asked you to stop

### Unauthorized Access and Security Violations

Our Products must not be used to:

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any system, network, or account
- Probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our systems without authorization
- Interfere with service to any user, host, or network
- Forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers to disguise the origin of any content

### Cooperative-Specific Prohibitions

In addition to the above, the following are specific to our cooperative context:

- **Do not weaponize patronage data.** Patronage records, contribution histories, and participation data exist for cooperative accounting and democratic governance — not for coercion, shaming, or manipulation of fellow members.
- **Respect democratic processes.** Do not use our platforms to undermine, manipulate, or circumvent the cooperative's democratic decision-making processes, including votes, proposals, and deliberations.
- **Do not misrepresent cooperative decisions.** Do not falsely claim that actions or positions have been approved by the cooperative or its governance bodies.
- **Protect the commons.** Do not extract value from the shared knowledge graph in ways that violate the Peer Production License or undermine the cooperative nature of the commons.

## Reporting Violations

If you become aware of any violation of this policy, please report it to:

**RegenHub, LCA**
Email: conduct@regenhub.xyz

We take all reports seriously and will investigate promptly. We are committed to protecting the privacy of those who report violations in good faith.

## Enforcement

We believe in restorative approaches where possible. Our enforcement process generally follows these steps:

1. **Notice** — We inform you of the concern and ask for a response
2. **Dialogue** — We work with you to understand and resolve the situation
3. **Remediation** — We agree on steps to address the issue
4. **Restriction** — If necessary, we limit access to specific services
5. **Termination** — As a last resort, we terminate access

Immediate action (skipping to restriction or termination) may be taken in cases involving illegal activity, imminent harm, or severe violations.
