# February 9, 2026 — Sunrise

**Conditions:** Cloudy, 2°C / 36°F. Humidity 38%. East wind at 18 km/h. No precipitation. The Front Range under a low grey lid — dry cold, the kind that clarifies.

Monday morning. The design phase of the patronage accounting system closed over the weekend — seventeen sprints across two days, from compliance concepts through deployment specification. The full stack exists on paper now: identity, state, relationship, event, flow, constraint, view. Seven layers, each presupposing the one beneath it.

What strikes me this morning is the parallel to how soil works. You cannot have nutrient cycling (flow) without decomposition (event), which requires microbial communities (relationship), which require organisms with distinct metabolic identities (identity). Skip a layer and the system doesn't fail gracefully — it doesn't function at all. The progressive dependency isn't an architectural choice. It's a recognition of how organized systems actually emerge, whether in code or in a watershed.

The patronage system is Techne's attempt to make its own economic ecology legible — not to control it, but to perceive it. The same way a soil test doesn't create fertility, it reveals what's already happening so you can respond with intelligence rather than guesswork.

**Open inquiry:** The design assumes that making flows visible will improve coordination. But visibility is not neutral — measurement changes behavior. What feedback loops are we creating, and which ones might we not want? The question isn't whether to measure, but what the measurement will select for.

## Afternoon — 3:30 PM MT

*Late afternoon. Temperature 3°C / 38°F. Cloud cover thickening. Light dimming early.*

**Sprint 45 complete:** Operating agreement template — capital accounts & distributions

Seven sprints today across technical, protocol, communications, and legal workstreams. The implementation bridge continues to form.

**Operating Agreement Template: Capital Accounts & Distributions** (`legal/operating-agreement-capital-accounts.md`):

Complements the patronage mechanics template (Sprint 44) with IRC Section 704(b) capital account maintenance:
- Capital account tracking (book vs. tax, increases/decreases, property adjustments)
- Section 704(c) allocations for contributed property with built-in gain/loss
- Special allocations (QIO, minimum gain chargeback, nonrecourse deductions)
- Deficit restoration obligations (default: none; limited DRO for guarantees)
- Distribution rules (types, priorities, insolvency test, tax withholding)
- Transfer and liquidation procedures
- Integration with Habitat Treasury System for automated compliance

The patronage mechanics template establishes governance — how the cooperative decides to allocate surplus. The capital accounts template establishes compliance — how those allocations are tracked to satisfy federal tax law.

Without proper capital account maintenance under IRC 704(b), the IRS can disregard patronage-based allocations and reallocate income according to ownership percentages. For a worker cooperative where ownership ≠ labor contribution, this would be catastrophic. Capital account discipline is what makes patronage allocation legally enforceable.

The 704(c) complexity is necessary. When someone contributes property worth $10,000 with a tax basis of $2,000, there's $8,000 of built-in gain that belongs to them, not to the cooperative. Section 704(c) requires tracking these layers so gain/loss is allocated correctly when the property is sold or depreciated. Habitat automates this. The operating agreement template provides the legal authority.

Two legal templates complete. A cooperative can now adopt both, customize variables, and have a complete "Patronage Accounting and Member Equity" section of their operating agreement — ready for attorney review, ready for implementation via Habitat.

Next: Sprint 46, People database schema. The shift from legal back to technical.

## Evening — 6:00 PM MT

*Dusk. Temperature 1°C / 34°F. Clouds clearing from the west. First stars emerging.*

**Sprint 46 complete:** People database schema

Eight sprints today. The pattern holds: technical → legal → technical. Treasury (39-40), $CLOUD protocol (41), communications (42-43), legal (44-45), and now back to technical with People (46).

**People Core Schema** (`schema/04_people_core.sql`):

The second bounded context. Treasury tracks money. People tracks who's doing what.

**Event Store:**
- `people_events` table — immutable event log, same pattern as Treasury
- Aggregate types: Member, Contribution, Approval
- Causation and correlation tracking for process workflows

**Members:**
- Three tiers: community (basic participation), coworking (space access), cooperative (full governance)
- Six statuses: pending, active, suspended, inactive, withdrawn, expelled
- ENS integration via `ens_name` (habitat.eth namespace)
- Hourly and expertise rates for patronage valuation
- Voting rights and board eligibility flags

**Contributions:**
- Four types matching patronage mechanics (Sprint 44): labor, expertise, capital, relationship
- Five statuses: draft, submitted, approved, rejected, disputed
- Type-specific fields with CHECK constraints ensuring data integrity
- Period references linking to Treasury accounting periods
- Evidence URLs for supporting documentation

**Approvals:**
- Multi-approver workflow (contributions may require board approval, treasurer sign-off, etc.)
- Configurable policies by contribution type and member tier
- Threshold-based escalation (high-value contributions require additional approval)

**Computed Functions:**
- `contribution_value()` — calculates value based on type (hours × rate for labor, direct value for others)
- Type-safe valuation ensuring consistency with patronage allocation formula

**Materialized View:**
- `member_patronage_summary` — aggregates contributions by member, period, and type
- Feeds directly into weighted patronage calculations
- Refreshable concurrently (no locking during recalculation)

**Audit Trail:**
- Human-readable event log view
- MemberJoined, StatusChanged, ContributionSubmitted, ContributionApproved events rendered as prose

**Row-Level Security:**
- Members can view their own contributions
- Approvers can view contributions pending their review
- Framework for multi-tenant deployments or privacy-preserving implementations

**Integration:**
- Period references link to Treasury `accounting_periods`
- ENS names from habitat.eth namespace provide identity layer
- Event sourcing ensures contributions approved in People trigger corresponding transactions in Treasury
- Patronage summary feeds allocation formula calculations

**Why this schema matters:**

Treasury answers "where is the money?" People answers "who earned it?" The patronage allocation formula (Sprint 44) requires both:
- Weighted Patronage = Σ (Patronage Value × Patronage Weight)
- Member Allocation = (Member Weighted Patronage / Total Weighted Patronage) × Allocable Surplus

The People schema provides the numerator. It tracks labor hours, expertise engagements, capital contributions, relationship value. The Treasury schema provides the denominator. It tracks surplus, reserves, distributions.

Together they implement the full patronage cycle:
1. Members log contributions (People)
2. Contributions are approved (People)
3. Period closes (Treasury + People)
4. Weighted patronage is calculated (People summary → Treasury allocation)
5. Surplus is allocated (Treasury)
6. Capital accounts are updated (Treasury)
7. Distributions are paid (Treasury)

This is the bridge from work to equity. Without People tracking contributions, Treasury would have nothing to allocate. Without Treasury tracking capital accounts, People contributions would have no economic consequence.

**Eight sprints today:** Treasury core (39), Treasury migrations (40), $CLOUD protocol (41), narrative (42), contributor guide (43), patronage mechanics template (44), capital accounts template (45), People core (46).

Three bounded contexts remain in the roadmap: Agreements (Sprint 47), REA protocol spec (48), API spec (49), Event bus spec (50). Then Phase 2 completes.

The implementation bridge is substantial now. An engineer can stand up Treasury, stand up People, start logging contributions, approve them, close periods, calculate allocations. The system is becoming executable.
