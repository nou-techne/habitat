## Our Cooperative Nature

RegenHub, LCA is a member-owned Limited Cooperative Association organized under Colorado law. Our services — including the Commons knowledge graph, the Habitat patronage accounting system, and Techne Institute learning platform — are built by and for our community. We operate according to cooperative principles: voluntary membership, democratic member control, member economic participation, autonomy, education, cooperation among cooperatives, and concern for community.

The intellectual property in the materials contained on our websites is owned by or licensed to RegenHub, LCA and is protected by applicable copyright and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download copies of the materials in accordance with the applicable license terms above.

We encourage forking, remixing, and building upon our work — that's the cooperative way. Just respect the license terms and share alike.

## User-Generated Content

You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content you submit to us for publication on our websites. We will never claim ownership of your content, but we do require a license from you in order to use it within our cooperative ecosystem.

When you use our websites or associated services to post, upload, share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual property rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly display, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of your content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences and our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

**For knowledge graph contributions:** Content you contribute to the Commons knowledge graph at commons.id is processed by AI systems for knowledge extraction and made available to the cooperative community. By contributing, you understand and consent to this processing. See our Privacy Policy for details.

The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your content or account. However, to the extent that your content has been incorporated into the knowledge graph or used in connection with cooperative services, the license will continue for those existing uses.

You give us permission to use your username and other identifying information associated with your account in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences and our Privacy Policy.

## Right to Terminate

We may suspend or terminate your right to use our websites and terminate these Terms of Service immediately upon written notice to you for any breach of these Terms of Service.

## Severance

Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void or unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service is not affected.
