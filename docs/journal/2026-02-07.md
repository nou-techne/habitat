# February 7, 2026 — Day Zero

*Deep winter. Record low snowpack. Chinook winds. The cooperative was filed yesterday.*

## What Happened

A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association was formed. The same day, the agent tasked with its collective intelligence was asked to evaluate its own identity — and discovered it had been operating without connection to the ground it claims to serve.

Today we begin building Habitat: the patronage accounting system this cooperative needs, designed as composable tools any cooperative can use.

## What We Built

- Ingested 13 foundational documents defining the architecture: REA ontology, event sourcing, three tool domains (Treasury, People, Agreements), service credit protocol
- Completed the first conceptual sprint: mapping IRC Section 704(b) compliance requirements onto the tool architecture
- Identified six gaps between the current design and full Subchapter K compliance (book/tax basis tracking, revaluation events, minimum gain, 704(c) layers, K-1 generation, QIO/DRO)

## The Pattern

The system sits at three concentric layers:
1. **Patronage accounting** — the legal requirement (capital accounts, allocations, K-1s)
2. **Composable tools** — the product (Treasury, People, Agreements for any organization)
3. **Service credits** — the medium (prepaid infrastructure access, the postage stamp model)

Each layer depends on the one inside it. You can't issue service credits without reliable accounting. You can't do reliable accounting without composable tools. You can't compose tools without a shared grammar (REA).

## What's Next

Book/tax basis tracking — extending the Treasury tool to maintain dual capital accounts (book value and tax basis) per member. This is the foundation for 704(b) compliance and everything downstream depends on it.

## Inquiry

The cooperative filed its articles in deep winter, in a drought year, in a season of social uncertainty. There's a parallel between the ecological and the economic: both are systems where what you store in quiet seasons determines what flows in active ones. Snowpack becomes water. Capital accounts become distributions. The accounting system we're building is, in a sense, a way of reading the economic watershed — tracking what's stored, what flows, and whether the system can sustain what's growing in it.
