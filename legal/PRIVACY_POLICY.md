# Privacy Policy

**RegenHub, LCA** · DBA Techne Institute
A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association · Boulder, Colorado

*Effective February 11, 2026*

---

Your privacy is important to us. As a cooperative, we believe in **data sovereignty**: you own your data, and the cooperative stewards it on your behalf. It is RegenHub, LCA's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our websites — [commons.id](https://commons.id), [the-habitat.org](https://the-habitat.org), and [techne.institute](https://techne.institute) — and other services we own and operate.

This policy covers our three primary services:

- **Commons** (commons.id) — A collaborative knowledge graph
- **Habitat** (the-habitat.org) — Patronage accounting and cooperative operations
- **Techne Institute** (techne.institute) — Learning and capacity building

In the event our sites contain links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our sites.

## Our Data Principles

As a member-owned cooperative, we hold ourselves to a higher standard than conventional data practices:

1. **You own your data.** We steward it; we don't exploit it.
2. **No advertising. No data sales. Ever.** Our revenue comes from member patronage, not surveillance.
3. **Transparency.** We tell you exactly what we collect, why, and who processes it.
4. **Minimal collection.** We gather only what we need to provide our services.
5. **Democratic oversight.** Data governance policies are subject to member input.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account information:** Email address (used for magic link authentication), display name, and optional affiliation/organization
- **Knowledge graph contributions:** Text, references, annotations, and other content you contribute to the Commons at commons.id — these are **public by design** as part of the shared knowledge commons
- **Participation data:** Your engagement with learning materials on Techne Institute, patronage activity recorded in Habitat
- **Communications:** Messages you send to us or other members through our platforms

### Information Automatically Collected

- **Log data:** Your browser type, IP address, pages visited, time and date of visit, and time spent on pages
- **Device data:** Device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers
- **Error data:** Technical details when errors occur, to help us improve our services

## AI Processing — Transparency Notice

**We use artificial intelligence to process contributions to the knowledge graph.** Specifically:

- Contributions to Commons (commons.id) are processed by **Claude** (Anthropic's AI) for knowledge extraction, summarization, connection-finding, and graph construction
- This processing helps organize collective knowledge and surface connections between ideas
- AI-generated outputs are marked as such and are always subject to human review
- Your raw contributions remain yours; AI-derived knowledge becomes part of the cooperative commons

We believe in being straightforward about AI's role in our systems. If you have questions about how your contributions are processed, please reach out.

## How We Use Your Information

We collect and use personal information for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain our cooperative services
- To authenticate your identity via magic link email
- To record and attribute your contributions to the knowledge graph
- To calculate patronage and participation for cooperative accounting
- To communicate with you about your account and our services
- To improve our platforms and user experience
- To comply with legal obligations
- For security and fraud prevention

We will **never** use your information for:

- Advertising or marketing by third parties
- Sale to data brokers or any third party
- Profiling for purposes unrelated to cooperative services
- Any purpose inconsistent with cooperative principles

## Third-Party Service Providers

We use the following third-party services to operate our platforms:

| Provider | Purpose | Data Shared |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Supabase** | Database hosting and authentication | Email, account data, contributions |
| **Anthropic** | AI-powered knowledge extraction (Claude) | Knowledge graph contributions (text content) |
| **GitHub** | Code hosting and deployment | No personal user data |

Each provider is selected for their alignment with our values and is bound by their own privacy policies and our data processing agreements. We do not share personal information with any other third parties.

## Data Retention

- **Account data:** Retained while your account is active, deleted upon request
- **Knowledge graph contributions:** As part of the public commons, contributions persist in the graph even after account deletion, but can be anonymized upon request
- **Log and device data:** Retained for no more than 90 days
- **Patronage records:** Retained as required by Colorado cooperative law and our operating agreement

## Your Rights

Regardless of your location, we extend the following rights to all users — inspired by GDPR principles, because we believe everyone deserves strong data protections:

- **Right to access:** Request a copy of all personal data we hold about you
- **Right to rectification:** Correct inaccurate personal data
- **Right to erasure:** Request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal retention requirements and commons contributions, which may be anonymized rather than deleted)
- **Right to restrict processing:** Limit how we use your data
- **Right to data portability:** Receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format
- **Right to object:** Object to processing of your personal data
- **Right to withdraw consent:** Withdraw consent at any time for consent-based processing

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at the address below. We will respond within 30 days.

## Security

We protect your personal information within commercially acceptable means, including encryption in transit and at rest. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy
