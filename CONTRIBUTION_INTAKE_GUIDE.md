## For Members: Submitting Contributions

### What to Submit

**Submit everything you contributed to Techne/RegenHub in Q1 2026:**

**Labor Contributions:**
- Hours worked on cooperative projects
- Services provided to the cooperative
- Expertise shared (meetings, consulting, mentoring)
- Project management, coordination
- Design, development, operations work

**Capital Contributions:**
- Cash invested in the cooperative
- Equipment purchased for cooperative use
- Space provided (if monetized)

**Property Contributions:**
- Equipment donated
- Intellectual property contributed
- Assets provided to cooperative

### How Much to Claim

**Labor Rate Guidelines:**
- **Default:** $100/hour (market rate for skilled labor)
- **Senior/specialized:** $125-150/hour (if justified)
- **Junior/learning:** $75-100/hour
- **Volunteer coordination:** $50-75/hour

**When in doubt:** Use $100/hour and note if you think adjustment needed

**Capital/Property:**
- Use actual dollar amounts
- For property: fair market value (get appraisal if > $1000)

### Submission Best Practices

**Be Detailed:**
```
✓ Good: "4 hours implementing member onboarding automation. 
Created create-member.sh script with secure password generation, 
credential file generation, and email templates. Tested with 3 
sample members. PR: github.com/nou-techne/habitat/pull/45"

✗ Bad: "Worked on onboarding stuff"
```

**Be Timely:**
- Submit weekly (don't wait until March 31)
- Submit within 1 week of doing work
- Easier to remember details when fresh

**Be Honest:**
- Only claim work actually done
- Use reasonable rates
- Don't inflate hours or amounts

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I submit volunteer time?**
A: Yes! If it benefited the cooperative, submit it. Use appropriate rate for the work.

**Q: Can I submit meeting attendance?**
A: Yes, if substantial time (>1 hour) and productive. Don't submit casual chat time.

**Q: What about learning/training?**
A: Submit if directly applied to cooperative work. Don't submit general learning not used.

**Q: I made a mistake in my submission. Can I fix it?**
A: You can't edit submissions (audit trail), but you can submit a correction with negative amount and resubmit correctly.

## For Stewards: Reviewing Contributions

### Your Role

As a steward, you review and approve (or reject) member contributions. Your job is to:

1. **Verify accuracy** - Is the amount reasonable?
2. **Verify value** - Did this work benefit the cooperative?
3. **Request clarification** - If description unclear or amount questionable
4. **Approve quickly** - Don't delay good contributions
5. **Maintain fairness** - Apply consistent standards

### Review Process

**1. Access Approval Queue**
- Navigate to https://habitat.eth/approvals
- You'll see all pending contributions
- Sorted by submission date (oldest first)

**2. Review Each Contribution**

For each contribution, check:

**Amount Reasonable?**
- Labor: Hours × rate makes sense?
- Rate appropriate for work type? ($75-150/hour typical)
- Capital: Matches receipts/records?
- Property: Fair market value reasonable?

**Description Adequate?**
- What was done?
- When was it done?
- What was the outcome/deliverable?
- Can you verify this happened?

**Value Created?**
- Did this benefit the cooperative?
- Would we have paid for this work?
- Is it core to cooperative mission?

**3. Take Action**

**If Good → Approve:**
- Click "Approve"
- Add approval note (optional): "Looks good, thanks!"
- Click "Confirm"

**If Unclear → Request Clarification:**
- Click "Request Clarification"
- Explain what you need: "Can you provide more detail about what was delivered?"
- Member gets notification
- Wait for response, then re-review

**If Problematic → Reject (rare):**
- Click "Reject"
- Explain why: "Amount seems high for 2 hours of work. Can you resubmit with more reasonable estimate?"
- Suggest resubmission with corrections

### Review Guidelines

**Approve Liberally:**
- If you trust the member and it's reasonable → approve
- Don't nitpick small amounts
- Don't delay good contributions

**Request Clarification When:**
- Description too vague to verify
- Amount much higher than expected
- Type of work unclear
- Need confirmation it happened

**Reject Rarely:**
- Only if clearly wrong (inflated, didn't happen, etc.)
- Always explain why
- Suggest how to correct and resubmit

**Response Time:**
- Target: Review within 48 hours
- Urgent: Same-day for time-sensitive requests
- Don't let queue back up

### Common Issues

**Issue: Amount seems high**
- Ask: "This seems like a lot for X hours. Can you break down what was included?"
- Don't just reject - understand first

**Issue: Description vague**
- Ask: "Can you provide more detail about what was delivered? Any links to PRs, docs, artifacts?"

**Issue: Work may not have benefited cooperative**
- Ask: "How did this work benefit the cooperative specifically?"
- Discuss: Maybe it counts partially?

**Issue: Member submitting too much**
- Check: Is pattern reasonable over time?
- Discuss: Privately, not via rejection
- Governance: Bring to meeting if systemic

**Issue: Unsure if should approve**
- Ask another steward
- Discuss in #habitat Slack
- Better to approve questionable than block good work

### Approval Stats to Track

Monitor your reviews:
- **Approval rate:** Target 90%+ (most should be good)
- **Average review time:** Target <48 hours
- **Clarification requests:** <10% (most should be clear)

If you're rejecting >20% or requesting clarification on >20%, you may be too strict.

### Progress Tracking

**Dashboard Metrics:**
1. **Member Participation:** % of members who submitted at least one contribution

5. **Average Response Time:** How long stewards take to review

## Troubleshooting

### Member Issues

**Problem:** Member says they can't find contribution form

**Solution:**
1. Direct them to https://habitat.eth/contributions/new
2. Or: Dashboard → "Submit New Contribution" button
3. Screenshot and send if needed

**Problem:** Member not sure what to submit

**Solution:**
1. Ask: "What have you worked on for Techne/RegenHub in Q1?"
2. Prompt: "Meetings, coding, design, ops, fundraising, planning?"
3. Remind: "Even 1-2 hours counts, helps us see patterns"

**Problem:** Member thinks their rate is too high/low

**Solution:**
1. Default guidance: $100/hour
2. Higher OK if specialized ($125-150)
3. Lower OK if learning-focused ($75)
4. Ask: "What would you charge a client?"

**Problem:** Member made mistake in submission

**Solution:**
1. Can't edit (audit trail)
2. Submit correction: Negative amount with note "Correction for [ID]"
3. Then submit corrected version
4. We'll reconcile during review

### Steward Issues

**Problem:** Steward not sure if should approve

**Solution:**
1. If reasonable and trustworthy → approve
2. If unsure → request clarification
3. If confused → ask another steward
4. Better to approve questionable than block good

**Problem:** Steward worried about being "too easy"

**Solution:**
1. Remember: We trust members
2. System is learning, not punitive
3. Patterns matter more than individual submissions
4. Approve liberally in Year 1

**Problem:** Large backlog of pending reviews

**Solution:**
1. Set aside 30-60 minutes to batch review
2. Approve obvious ones quickly
3. Request clarification on unclear ones
4. Don't overthink it

### System Issues

**Problem:** Performance slow during peak usage

**Solution:**
1. Check https://habitat.eth/health
2. Monitor server resources (htop)
3. Check database query performance
4. Scale up if needed

**Problem:** Database connection errors

**Solution:**
1. Check PostgreSQL status
2. Check connection pool usage
3. Restart API/Worker if needed
4. Check logs for specific errors

**Problem:** Events not processing

**Solution:**
