# Composable Organization Tools: The Opportunity

## The Gap

Organizations need software to manage their operations: tracking contributions, maintaining accounts, managing agreements, attributing revenue, compensating people.

Current solutions force a choice between comprehensive platforms (expensive, rigid, opinionated) or disconnected point solutions (fragmented, manual integration, data silos).

Neither approach serves the emerging landscape of cooperatives, DAOs, multi-stakeholder organizations, and hybrid structures that do not fit neatly into "corporation" or "nonprofit" boxes. These organizations need tools that compose rather than constrain.

## The Approach

Build a collection of small, focused tools that each solve one problem well. Each tool has a distinct purpose and a clean data pattern. Tools can be adopted independently or composed together. The same primitives serve a sole proprietor, a worker cooperative, a venture studio, or an enterprise division.

**Treasury** tracks flows of value in and out. Accounts, transactions, balances, reconciliation.

**People** manages contributors and their stakes. Roles, equity, compensation, contribution history.

**Agreements** defines relationships and terms between parties. Contribution expectations, allocation formulas, distribution rules.

The underlying pattern across all tools: Resources, Events, and Agents. This ontology (from REA accounting theory) provides the common language that lets tools interoperate without forcing a monolithic architecture.

## The Opportunity

The market is broad precisely because the tools are composable. A freelancer needs Treasury and Agreements. A startup needs People and Treasury. A cooperative needs all of them configured for patronage-based allocation. Same primitives, different compositions.

Building these tools for a real cooperative creates immediate internal value while producing components that other organizations can use. The investment pays for itself if the tools work internally. Adoption by others validates the composable approach and funds continued development.
