# February 10, 2026 — Monday

**Conditions:** Late winter on the Front Range. The days are lengthening — sunrise before 7, sunset pushing past 5:30. Great Horned Owls are nesting now, the earliest breeders in the region, brooding eggs while snow still covers the ground. Their timing is not optimism but calibration: the young must be ready to hunt by the time spring abundance arrives. Preparation precedes opportunity.

## Sprint Versioning Journal

### Infrastructure Block: Sprints 51–55 (Retroactive)

The infrastructure block closed on February 9. Five sprints in one session, converting twelve specification documents into deployment-ready architecture. What follows is the retroactive assessment with role mapping, phase classification, and sprint typing — establishing the journal format going forward.

---

**Sprint 51: Deployment Architecture**
- **Artifact:** `habitat/infrastructure/deployment-architecture.md` (32KB)
- **Phase:** 3 — Production Deployment
- **Sprint Type:** Infrastructure
- **Layer:** 7 (View) — deployment is the outermost container that presents all lower layers to the world
- **TIO Role:** Frontend & DevOps Engineer (`07-frontend-devops.md`)
- **Content:** Docker Compose stacks (dev + prod), 6 services (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, API, Worker, Frontend, Caddy), monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki), Terraform AWS example, cost estimates ($30–60/month self-hosted vs. $235/month managed)
- **Key Decision:** Self-hosted VPS recommended over managed cloud for early-stage cooperative economics
- **Commit:** `d06ae17`

**Sprint 52: Database Deployment Guide**
- **Artifact:** `habitat/infrastructure/database-deployment.md` (21KB)
- **Phase:** 3 — Production Deployment
- **Sprint Type:** Infrastructure
- **Layer:** 2 (State) — database deployment operationalizes the state layer
- **TIO Role:** Backend Engineer (`02-backend-engineer.md`)
- **Content:** Schema deployment order and automation, 3 application roles (read/write/audit), RLS policies, seed data, verification procedures, migration tracking, backup/restore, production checklist
- **Key Decision:** Three-role separation (app_readonly, app_readwrite, app_audit) enforced via RLS — least-privilege by default
- **Commit:** `5b3501e`

**Sprint 53: API Server Core Queries**
- **Artifact:** `habitat/infrastructure/api-server-core.md` (29KB)
- **Phase:** 3 — Production Deployment
- **Sprint Type:** Implementation
- **Layer:** 7 (View) — API queries present state to consumers
- **TIO Role:** Backend Engineer (`02-backend-engineer.md`) + Integration Engineer (`03-integration-engineer.md`)
- **Content:** Apollo Server 4, GraphQL schemas (Common/Treasury/People/Agreements), query resolvers, data source layer, JWT authentication + RLS session context, Relay-style pagination
- **Key Decision:** JWT claims flow into PostgreSQL session variables for RLS — authorization at the database layer, not the application layer
- **Commit:** `212655a`

**Sprint 54: API Server Mutations**
- **Artifact:** `habitat/infrastructure/api-server-mutations.md` (39KB)
- **Phase:** 3 — Production Deployment
- **Sprint Type:** Implementation
- **Layer:** 4 (Event) + 6 (Constraint) — mutations record events and enforce business rules
- **TIO Role:** Backend Engineer (`02-backend-engineer.md`) + Compliance & Security Engineer (`06-compliance-security.md`)
- **Content:** 15 mutations across 3 contexts, role-based authorization (member/bookkeeper/governance), event publishing, transaction management, multi-approver contribution workflow, double-entry validation
- **Key Decision:** Multi-approver workflow for contributions — no single point of approval. Double-entry validation enforced at mutation boundary, not just schema constraints.
- **Commit:** `2c17387`

**Sprint 55: Event Bus Implementation**
- **Artifact:** `habitat/infrastructure/event-bus-implementation.md` (25KB)
- **Phase:** 3 — Production Deployment
- **Sprint Type:** Infrastructure
- **Layer:** 5 (Flow) — event bus is the flow layer made operational
- **TIO Role:** Event Systems Engineer (`04-event-systems-engineer.md`)
- **Content:** RabbitMQ topology (3 exchanges, 4 handler queues, DLX), handlers (patronage/allocation/capital-account/distribution), idempotency tracking, retry strategy, Prometheus metrics, testing strategy
- **Key Decision:** Dead letter exchange with manual replay — failed events are preserved, not discarded. Idempotency via event_id tracking prevents duplicate processing.
- **Commit:** `887da90`

### Block Assessment

**Pattern Coverage:**
- Layer 1 (Identity): ✓ Addressed in Phase 1-2 schemas
- Layer 2 (State): ✓ Sprint 52 (database deployment)
- Layer 3 (Relationship): ✓ Sprint 53 (API data sources connecting contexts)
- Layer 4 (Event): ✓ Sprint 54 (mutations as event producers)
- Layer 5 (Flow): ✓ Sprint 55 (event bus as flow infrastructure)
- Layer 6 (Constraint): ✓ Sprint 54 (authorization, validation, double-entry)
- Layer 7 (View): ✓ Sprint 51 (deployment), Sprint 53 (API queries)

**Role Distribution:** Backend Engineer appeared in 3/5 sprints — expected for infrastructure block. Event Systems Engineer and DevOps each appeared once. Compliance cross-cut Sprint 54. No Frontend work yet — that begins with Sprint 56.

**Sprint Type Distribution:** Infrastructure (3), Implementation (2). The block was correctly weighted toward operational scaffolding.

**Observation:** The infrastructure block moved from outside-in (deployment container first, then database, then API, then events). This is unusual — most teams start inside-out. The rationale: knowing the deployment shape constrains implementation decisions. You design differently when you know the container.

*Next: Sprint 56 begins the Essential UI block. Frontend Foundation — the first artifact where members will touch the system directly.*
