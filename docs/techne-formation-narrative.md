# From Scenius to Structure: The Formation of Techne

*How eight people moved from informal alignment to legal cooperative in 60 days*

---

In late 2025, a group of practitioners occupied the third floor of a building in Boulder, Colorado. They shared space, tools, and increasingly, clients. But they operated as separate entities—solo LLCs, freelancers, informal collaborators. The question emerged: *What would it mean to formalize what we're already doing?*

The answer wasn't obvious. Traditional incorporation concentrates ownership and governance in founders. That felt wrong for a group that had organically developed democratic habits—rotating facilitation, consensus-seeking, shared resources. The alternative—remaining informal—exposed everyone to liability and made external capital inaccessible.

The solution: a **Limited Cooperative Association (LCA)**, a Colorado entity type designed precisely for this hybrid case. Democratic governance. Flexible membership classes. Ability to accept outside investment without losing member control.

## The Liability Problem

The first conversation centered on risk. Who's responsible when things go wrong? Under informal collaboration, everyone is exposed. Under a cooperative, liability is distributed through the entity. This wasn't abstract—several practitioners had faced situations where the line between "my client" and "our space" blurred uncomfortably. Shared equipment, shared clients, shared reputation—but no shared structure to hold it.

The LCA structure resolved this by creating a legal container. The entity holds contracts, insurance, and obligations. Members participate through defined relationships rather than ad-hoc arrangements. The REA (Resource, Event, Agent) framework provided the conceptual grammar: every economic relationship involves identifiable agents, observable events, and quantifiable resources. Making these relationships explicit through legal structure was the first step toward making them computable.

## Visioning Scenius

What exactly were we formalizing? Not just a coworking space. Not a traditional business incubator. The working concept was **scenius**—Brian Eno's term for the collective intelligence that emerges when culturally aligned people share sustained proximity.

The venture studio model crystallized: Techne wouldn't be a company that does things. It would be infrastructure that enables ventures. The physical space, the legal structure, the operational systems—all of it was *soil* for cultivation, not the plant itself.

## Soil, Not Plant

This distinction proved essential. Early discussions conflated the cooperative with its member ventures. But a music label isn't a band. A venture studio isn't a startup. Techne (the studio) and RegenHub (the LCA) are the container and legal vessel that enable ventures to grow, mature, and eventually exit into their own structures.

This reframing changed everything. The LCA doesn't need to capture all value from ventures—it needs to enable their success and receive appropriate reciprocity for infrastructure provided.

## Reinvestment Over Distribution

Traditional cooperatives distribute surplus to members. Techne chose a different path: community reinvestment. Net operating surplus flows primarily to grants and community benefit, not individual payouts.

This wasn't altruism—it was alignment. The members were already earning through their ventures. What they needed from the cooperative was infrastructure, legitimacy, and coordination. Turning it into a profit-distribution vehicle would create misaligned incentives.

The public benefit statement reflected this: *cultivating scenius*—supporting the conditions for collective intelligence to emerge.

## Protocol Design

How do you track contributions in a system where value creation is diffuse and long-term? Traditional accounting captures transactions, not relationships. When a member spends three hours mentoring a venture founder, that's real value—but it doesn't show up on a balance sheet. When the studio's reputation attracts a new tenant, no single person generated that revenue. The formation conversations explored:

- **Mutual credit** for internal exchange
- **Multi-capital currencies** recognizing different contribution types
- **Patronage tracking** connecting member contributions to revenue generated

These remained aspirational during formation—the legal structure came first. But the conversation shaped the bylaws to enable experimentation with contribution tracking and non-monetary value flows.

## Implementation: Three Tiers

Membership structure crystallized into three tiers:

1. **Community Members:** Access to events, communications, basic participation
2. **Co-working Members:** Physical space access, operational benefits
3. **Cooperative Members:** Full governance rights, equity stake, voting authority

This allows permeable boundaries—people can engage at their comfort level and deepen involvement over time. Investor members slot into the cooperative tier with specific rights and obligations defined in separate agreements.

## Revenue Architecture

How does the infrastructure sustain itself? Three revenue streams:

1. **Space revenue:** Rent, events, shared resources
2. **Service revenue:** Formation assistance, business planning, back-office support
3. **Venture reciprocity:** 1% commitment from ventures back to the Hub

The last point sparked the most debate. Techne doesn't ask for equity in ventures—that creates extraction incentives. Instead, ventures reciprocate for infrastructure received, at a rate they define. Early ventures might commit 1% of revenue. Larger ones might contribute through sponsorship, knowledge sharing, or service provision.

## Place-Based Grounding

Techne isn't placeless. It exists on the third floor of 1515 Walnut Street, Boulder, Colorado—in the Colorado watershed, at 5,430 feet, where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains.

This grounding matters. The Neighborhood Village Project, the relationship with local government, the climate and seasonal rhythms—all of this shapes what Techne can become. This isn't a franchise model. It's something that belongs to this place.

## The Investor Question

Cooperatives have historically struggled with capital access. Traditional investors want equity, control, and exit liquidity—things that conflict with democratic member governance. This tension has kept many cooperatives small and undercapitalized. The result: cooperatives stay local and lean, while extractive structures absorb the growth capital.

Colorado's LCA statute offers a path through. Investor members can hold a distinct membership class with defined financial rights (distributions, appreciation, liquidity preferences) without controlling governance. The cooperative remains member-governed while accessing growth capital. This is the structural innovation that makes Techne possible—not a compromise between cooperative values and investor needs, but a legal architecture that aligns them.

The term sheet framework makes this explicit. Investors receive preferred return on contributed capital, pro-rata share of certain revenue streams, defined exit mechanisms, and board observer rights. What they don't receive: voting control over operations, mission, or membership. The cooperative's public benefit purpose isn't subject to investor override.

Kevin Owocki—co-founder of Gitcoin, lead investor—understood this immediately. His thesis: the most durable ventures emerge from ecosystems, not incubators. Investing in the cooperative infrastructure that produces ventures is a better bet than investing in any single venture. Patient capital, aligned incentives, compounding returns through ecosystem growth rather than individual exits.

This changes the investor relationship from extraction to alignment. Investors succeed when the cooperative succeeds. The structure creates patient capital compatible with long-term value creation.

## The Broader Movement

Techne isn't forming in isolation. It's part of a growing ecosystem of cooperative, commons-based, and regenerative economic experiments—platform cooperatives challenging gig economy extraction, community land trusts removing land from speculation, regenerative finance exploring blockchain-enabled coordination, solidarity economy networks building alternative supply chains.

What distinguishes Techne is the venture studio model—infrastructure that makes new ventures legible to both cooperative principles and external capital. Most cooperatives form around a single business. Techne forms around the capacity to *create* businesses, while ensuring they emerge with appropriate structure and values.

The web3 connection isn't incidental. Several organizers come from the Ethereum ecosystem, where experiments in decentralized governance, token-based coordination, and programmable money have stress-tested ideas about collective ownership. But Techne is deliberately physical, local, and legally grounded. The blockchain experiments are inputs, not the identity. What matters is the space, the relationships, the ventures that emerge.

## The Filing

On February 6, 2026, attorney Jeff Pote filed the Articles of Organization with the Colorado Secretary of State. RegenHub, LCA came into legal existence.

The organizers who consented: Aaron G Neyer, Benjamin Ross, Jonathan Borichevskiy, Kevin Owocki, Lucian Hymer, Neil Mackay Yarnal, Savannah Kruger, and Todd Youngblood.

The public benefit statement—"cultivating scenius"—was accepted by the attorney as "one of the best I've seen." It signals that this entity exists not primarily for member enrichment but for something harder to measure: the conditions that allow collective intelligence to emerge.

## What Comes Next

Techne's formation isn't the end of something—it's a foundation. The legal entity creates the container. Now the work is filling it: ventures being incubated and supported, members contributing and receiving value, infrastructure maturing to serve more participants, revenue streams flowing and being reinvested.

The first concrete expression is Habitat—a patronage accounting system that tracks contributions across four categories (labor, revenue, community, infrastructure), calculates allocations using a weighted formula, and reconciles on a daily solar cycle tied to sunrise and sunset over the Front Range. Daylight contributions are credited to individual capital accounts. Nighttime contributions flow to the collective pool. The system makes the cooperative's economic relationships visible, auditable, and alive.

This isn't just internal tooling. If a cooperative can track contributions, calculate allocations, and reconcile daily with transparent infrastructure, that capability becomes a product. Legibility-as-service for any organization that wants to see its own coordination clearly.

From informal alignment to legal reality in 60 days—not by abandoning the organic culture that made it work, but by giving it structure to scale.

The scenius continues. Now it has a home.
