# Sprint Deliverables

Artifacts produced during Habitat micro-sprints, organized by phase.

## Directories

- **`production/`** — Sprints 115-117: Q1 2026 period close, post-allocation review, bug triage
- **`enhancements/`** — Sprints 118-122: UI improvements, multi-period support, notifications, API docs, cooperative setup
- **`cloud-credits/`** — Sprints 123-126+: $CLOUD credit integration, Superfluid streams, identity/state layers
