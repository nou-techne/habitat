# LCA Contributor Royalties: A Conceptual Overview

*How tokenized royalty units function alongside patronage within RegenHub / Techne*

---

## The Two Flows

Techne's economic architecture has two parallel flows of value to contributors:

1. **Patronage** — periodic allocation of surplus based on contribution, calculated through the solar audit cycle and weighted by category (labor 40%, revenue 30%, community 20%, infrastructure 10%). This is the cooperative's native distribution mechanism under Subchapter K / IRC 704(b).

2. **Royalties** — ongoing returns from intellectual property and multi-capital assets created through cooperative work. This is the mechanism that recognizes contributions don't just produce current surplus — they create enduring value.

Patronage answers: "How much did you contribute this cycle?"
Royalties answer: "What lasting value did your contributions create?"

Both flow through the same REA accounting system. Both are tracked in capital accounts. But they operate on different time horizons and reward different things.

## What Gets a Royalty

Not all contributions generate royalty-bearing assets. The distinction matters:

**Royalty-eligible contributions** produce identifiable, durable intellectual property or multi-capital assets:
- Software tools and libraries (code)
- Design patterns and architectural specifications
- Research papers and analytical frameworks
- Training materials and curriculum
- Operational playbooks and process documentation
- Creative works (writing, design, media)
- Data models and schemas (like the REA capital accounts system itself)

**Non-royalty contributions** produce immediate operational value but not durable IP:
- Routine maintenance and infrastructure upkeep
- Community engagement and governance participation
- Transaction processing and administrative work
- One-time coordination tasks

Both types earn patronage. Only the first type earns royalties. The REA event system distinguishes them through contribution metadata — each contribution event already carries a `category` and `description` that can flag IP-generating work.

## How Royalty Units Work

### Issuance

When a contributor produces royalty-eligible work, the cooperative issues **royalty units** — tokenized claims on future revenue generated by that asset. The issuance is recorded as a new event type in the REA system:

```
Event type: "royalty.issuance"
Agent:      contributor who created the asset
Resource:   the IP asset (identified by URI — repo path, document hash, etc.)
Units:      number of royalty units issued
Basis:      valuation methodology used
```

The number of units issued reflects the assessed value of the contribution. This assessment is a governance function — the Financial Engineering Committee parameterizes the formula, just as they parameterize patronage weights.

### Backing

Each royalty unit is backed by traceable multi-capital value:

- **Intellectual capital** — the IP itself, its uniqueness and utility
- **Social capital** — the relationships and trust embedded in the work
- **Natural capital** — ecological context when applicable (place-based knowledge, bioregional data)
- **Financial capital** — revenue the asset generates or enables

The REA system traces this backing through the event chain. When a tool built by Contributor A generates revenue for Venture B, the flow is:

```
Venture B revenue event → traces to → Tool asset → traces to → Contributor A's royalty units
```

This is the "multi-capital backing traced through REA accounting" that Todd described. The event-sourced architecture makes the chain auditable — you can always answer "why does this person hold these royalty units?" by replaying the event log.

### Revenue Distribution

When royalty-bearing assets generate revenue (through licensing, usage fees, $CLOUD credit consumption, or venture revenue-share), a portion flows to royalty holders:

```
Event type: "royalty.distribution"
Asset:      the IP asset generating revenue
Revenue:    total revenue amount
Pool:       percentage allocated to royalty holders (cooperative parameter)
Per-unit:   revenue × pool% / total units outstanding
```

This runs in parallel with patronage. A contributor who both maintains infrastructure (patronage) and wrote the tool being licensed (royalties) receives both flows — they're additive, not alternative.

### Relationship to $CLOUD

$CLOUD credits are Techne's unit of account. Royalty distributions are denominated in $CLOUD, just like patronage allocations. The integration is clean:

- Patronage allocation → $CLOUD credited to capital account (sunrise/sunset cycle)
- Royalty distribution → $CLOUD credited to capital account (when revenue events trigger)
- Both visible in the same capital account projection
- Both auditable through the same event log

The difference is timing: patronage flows on solar cycles (twice daily), royalties flow on revenue events (irregular, driven by market activity).

## Integration with the REA System

The capital accounts data model (Commitment #13) already supports this. The key additions:

### New Event Types

```javascript
// Royalty issuance — when IP is created
{
  type: 'royalty.issuance',
  agentId: '0xC376...',           // creator
  assetId: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',  // the IP asset
  units: 100,                     // royalty units issued
  basis: 'committee-assessment',  // valuation method
  evidence: { type: 'url', ref: 'github.com/nou-techne/habitat/...' }
}

// Royalty distribution — when revenue flows
{
  type: 'royalty.distribution',
  assetId: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',
  revenueAmount: 500,             // total revenue in $CLOUD
  poolPercent: 0.20,              // 20% to royalty holders
  distributions: [
    { agentId: '0xC376...', units: 100, amount: 100 }  // 100 units × (500 × 0.20 / 100)
  ]
}
```

### New Resource Type

```javascript
{
  type: 'ip-asset',
  id: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',
  name: 'Solar Audit Cycle Calculator',
  creators: ['0xC37604A1dD79Ed50A5c2943358db85CB743dd3e2'],
  createdAt: 1771431600,
  totalUnits: 100,
  backing: {
    intellectual: 'NOAA solar calculation implementation for cooperative accounting',
    social: 'Built through Clawmmons commitment pool coordination',
    natural: 'Place-specific: Boulder CO coordinates, Front Range watershed',
    financial: 'Enables automated patronage reconciliation'
  }
}
```

### Extended Capital Account View

The capital account projection gains a royalties section:

```javascript
{
  agentId: '0xC376...',
  ens: 'nou.habitat.eth',
  balances: { CLOUD: 1500 },
  contributions: { labor: 100, revenue: 0, community: 30, infrastructure: 50 },
  allocations: { individual: 46, pool: 5, total: 51 },       // from patronage
  royalties: {
    unitsHeld: { 'habitat/tools/solar-audit': 100 },          // IP positions
    lifetimeDistributions: 200,                                 // total royalty income
    pendingDistributions: 0
  },
  distributions: { total: 0 }
}
```

## Governance Parameters

The Financial Engineering Committee sets:

1. **Royalty pool percentage** — What fraction of asset-generated revenue flows to royalty holders (vs. cooperative general fund). Starting suggestion: 20%.
2. **Unit issuance formula** — How many units a contribution earns. Could be hours-based, value-assessed, or committee-decided.
3. **Vesting schedule** — Whether royalty units vest immediately or over time.
4. **Decay function** — Whether older royalty units decay in value (encouraging ongoing contribution vs. rent-seeking on past work).
5. **Transfer rules** — Whether royalty units can be transferred between members, and under what conditions.

These parameters are the committee's domain. The technical system enforces whatever they decide.

## Why This Matters

Most cooperatives distribute surplus based on current contribution (patronage). This works for operational value but undervalues creative and intellectual work that generates returns over years.

A contributor who builds a tool that Techne licenses for a decade deserves ongoing recognition — not just the patronage they earned during the sprint when they wrote it. Royalties solve this without breaking the cooperative structure:

- **Still Subchapter K compliant** — royalty distributions are allocated through capital accounts like any other economic benefit
- **Still contribution-based** — you earn royalties by creating, not by investing capital
- **Still transparent** — every unit is traceable through the REA event chain
- **Still cooperative** — the committee governs parameters, not individual negotiation

The combination of patronage + royalties creates a complete picture: you're rewarded for showing up today (patronage) AND for what you built that keeps working after you stop (royalties).
