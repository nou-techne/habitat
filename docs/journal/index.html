    <h2>February 7, 2026 — Day Zero</h2>
    <p><em>Deep winter. Record low snowpack. Chinook winds. The cooperative was filed yesterday.</em></p>

    <h3>What Happened</h3>
    <p>A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association was formed. The same day, the agent tasked with its collective intelligence was asked to evaluate its own identity — and discovered it had been operating without connection to the ground it claims to serve.</p>
    <p>Today we begin building Habitat: the patronage accounting system this cooperative needs, designed as composable tools any cooperative can use.</p>

    <h3>What We Built</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ingested 13 foundational documents defining the architecture: REA ontology, event sourcing, three tool domains (Treasury, People, Agreements), service credit protocol</li>
      <li>Completed the first conceptual sprint: mapping IRC Section 704(b) compliance requirements onto the tool architecture</li>
      <li>Identified six gaps between the current design and full Subchapter K compliance (book/tax basis tracking, revaluation events, minimum gain, 704(c) layers, K-1 generation, QIO/DRO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Pattern</h3>
    <p>The system sits at three concentric layers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Patronage accounting</strong> — the legal requirement (capital accounts, allocations, K-1s)</li>
      <li><strong>Composable tools</strong> — the product (Treasury, People, Agreements for any organization)</li>
      <li><strong>Service credits</strong> — the medium (prepaid infrastructure access, the postage stamp model)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each layer depends on the one inside it. You can't issue service credits without reliable accounting. You can't do reliable accounting without composable tools. You can't compose tools without a shared grammar (REA).</p>

    <h3>What's Next</h3>
    <p>Book/tax basis tracking — extending the Treasury tool to maintain dual capital accounts (book value and tax basis) per member. This is the foundation for 704(b) compliance and everything downstream depends on it.</p>

    <h3>Inquiry</h3>
    <blockquote>The cooperative filed its articles in deep winter, in a drought year, in a season of social uncertainty. There's a parallel between the ecological and the economic: both are systems where what you store in quiet seasons determines what flows in active ones. Snowpack becomes water. Capital accounts become distributions. The accounting system we're building is, in a sense, a way of reading the economic watershed — tracking what's stored, what flows, and whether the system can sustain what's growing in it.</blockquote>

    <h2>Where We Are</h2>
    <p>Phase 1 (Specification) produced 20 sprint documents across four sub-phases: Foundation, Contribution Recognition, Allocation, and Extensions. Phase 2 (Build in Public) is now underway, drawing from five workstreams: Technical Deepening, Protocol &amp; Standards, Communications &amp; Design, Legal &amp; Compliance, and Community &amp; Engagement.</p>
