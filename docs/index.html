    <h2><i data-lucide="eye-off" class="section-icon icon-orange"></i> The Problem</h2>
    <p>Organizations can't see their own economic relationships. The accounting tools they rely on were built to track extraction — revenue captured, costs minimized, value concentrated. For any organization trying to do something different — a cooperative, a land trust, a mutual aid network — the tools available were designed for a different game entirely.</p>
    <p class="muted">When your tools can only measure extraction, extraction is all you can manage.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><i data-lucide="eye" class="section-icon icon-orange"></i> The Insight</h2>
    <p>Tools shape what you can see. What you can see determines whether you extract or enrich.</p>
    <p>An organization that wants to distribute governance, track contributions fairly, and strengthen the ecosystem it operates within needs tools built for that purpose. Not a spreadsheet adapted from corporate finance. Not a DAO dashboard with no legal standing. Infrastructure designed from the ground up for organizations that care about <em>how</em> value flows, not just <em>how much</em>.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="layers" class="section-icon"></i> What is Habitat</h2>
    <p>Three concentric layers of coordination infrastructure, each building on the one inside it:</p>

      <div class="layer-icon"><i data-lucide="scale"></i></div>
      <div class="layer-content">
        <h3>Patronage Accounting</h3>
        <p>Capital accounts, contribution tracking, and allocation calculations that satisfy IRC Section 704(b) compliance. The legal heartbeat of a cooperative — who contributed what, and how does value flow back? Built to the most rigorous standard first, so simpler organizations use simpler configurations of the same tools.</p>

        <h3>Composable Tools</h3>
        <p>Independent, event-sourced tools — Treasury, People, Agreements — unified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_events,_agents_(accounting_model)" style="color: var(--accent);">REA ontology</a>. Each tool solves one problem well. Together they compose into organizational infrastructure that makes economic relationships legible.</p>

        <h3>Service Credits</h3>
        <p>A prepaid medium for information economy infrastructure. Four resource primitives — compute, transfer, long-term memory, short-term memory. The postage stamp of cooperative infrastructure: simple, fungible, useful.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="map-pin" class="section-icon"></i> Context</h2>
    <p>Habitat is built in public by a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association. We needed these tools ourselves — and designed them so any organization can use them.</p>
    <p>The system satisfies the most demanding compliance requirements (IRC 704(b), Subchapter K), which means every simpler use case is already covered. A freelancer needs Treasury. A startup needs Treasury + People. A cooperative needs all three configured for patronage-based allocation. Same primitives, different compositions.</p>
    <p class="muted">Open source. Built in public. The repo is the project.</p>
