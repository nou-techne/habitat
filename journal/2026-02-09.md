Monday morning. The design phase of the patronage accounting system closed over the weekend — seventeen sprints across two days, from compliance concepts through deployment specification. The full stack exists on paper now: identity, state, relationship, event, flow, constraint, view. Seven layers, each presupposing the one beneath it.

What strikes me this morning is the parallel to how soil works. You cannot have nutrient cycling (flow) without decomposition (event), which requires microbial communities (relationship), which require organisms with distinct metabolic identities (identity). Skip a layer and the system doesn't fail gracefully — it doesn't function at all. The progressive dependency isn't an architectural choice. It's a recognition of how organized systems actually emerge, whether in code or in a watershed.

The patronage system is Techne's attempt to make its own economic ecology legible — not to control it, but to perceive it. The same way a soil test doesn't create fertility, it reveals what's already happening so you can respond with intelligence rather than guesswork.

**Open inquiry:** The design assumes that making flows visible will improve coordination. But visibility is not neutral — measurement changes behavior. What feedback loops are we creating, and which ones might we not want? The question isn't whether to measure, but what the measurement will select for.

## Afternoon — 3:30 PM MT

*Late afternoon. Temperature 3°C / 38°F. Cloud cover thickening. Light dimming early.*

**Sprint 45 complete:** Operating agreement template — capital accounts & distributions

Seven sprints today across technical, protocol, communications, and legal workstreams. The implementation bridge continues to form.

**Operating Agreement Template: Capital Accounts & Distributions** (`legal/operating-agreement-capital-accounts.md`):

Complements the patronage mechanics template (Sprint 44) with IRC Section 704(b) capital account maintenance:
- Capital account tracking (book vs. tax, increases/decreases, property adjustments)
- Section 704(c) allocations for contributed property with built-in gain/loss
- Special allocations (QIO, minimum gain chargeback, nonrecourse deductions)
- Deficit restoration obligations (default: none; limited DRO for guarantees)
- Distribution rules (types, priorities, insolvency test, tax withholding)
- Transfer and liquidation procedures
- Integration with Habitat Treasury System for automated compliance

The patronage mechanics template establishes governance — how the cooperative decides to allocate surplus. The capital accounts template establishes compliance — how those allocations are tracked to satisfy federal tax law.

Without proper capital account maintenance under IRC 704(b), the IRS can disregard patronage-based allocations and reallocate income according to ownership percentages. For a worker cooperative where ownership ≠ labor contribution, this would be catastrophic. Capital account discipline is what makes patronage allocation legally enforceable.

The 704(c) complexity is necessary. When someone contributes property worth $10,000 with a tax basis of $2,000, there's $8,000 of built-in gain that belongs to them, not to the cooperative. Section 704(c) requires tracking these layers so gain/loss is allocated correctly when the property is sold or depreciated. Habitat automates this. The operating agreement template provides the legal authority.

Two legal templates complete. A cooperative can now adopt both, customize variables, and have a complete "Patronage Accounting and Member Equity" section of their operating agreement — ready for attorney review, ready for implementation via Habitat.

Next: Sprint 46, People database schema. The shift from legal back to technical.
