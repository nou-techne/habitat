## Article [Y]: Capital Accounts and Distributions

### Section [Y].1 — Capital Account Maintenance

The Cooperative shall maintain a **Capital Account** for each Member in accordance with IRC Section 704(b) and Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Capital Accounts reflect each Member's economic interest in the Cooperative and determine allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction for tax purposes.

#### (a) Initial Capital Account Balance

Upon admission, each Member's Capital Account shall be credited with:
- Cash contributions to the Cooperative
- The fair market value of property contributed, net of liabilities assumed by the Cooperative
- Any amounts previously allocated to the Member (for existing Members)

#### (b) Increases to Capital Accounts

A Member's Capital Account shall be increased by:
- Additional cash or property contributions (valued at fair market value)
- The Member's share of Cooperative income and gain (as allocated under [Article X])
- The Member's share of tax-exempt income
- Increases required by special allocations under Section [Y].4

#### (c) Decreases to Capital Accounts

A Member's Capital Account shall be decreased by:
- Cash or property distributed to the Member (valued at fair market value)
- The Member's share of Cooperative losses and deductions (as allocated under [Article X])
- The Member's share of expenditures not deductible for tax purposes and not properly chargeable to capital
- Decreases required by special allocations under Section [Y].4

#### (d) Capital Account Adjustments for Property

When the Cooperative revalues property on its books (under Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)), or when property is contributed with built-in gain or loss, Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect:
- Book value vs. tax basis differences
- Revaluation events (new Member admission, property distribution, liquidation)
- Special allocations required to align book and tax treatment (Section [Y].4)

### Section [Y].2 — Book Capital Accounts vs. Tax Capital Accounts

The Cooperative shall maintain separate accounting records for **Book Capital Accounts** (reflecting GAAP or operational accounting) and **Tax Capital Accounts** (reflecting IRC Section 704(b) requirements).

#### (a) Book Capital Accounts

Book Capital Accounts track Member equity for financial reporting and internal management:
- Governed by the Cooperative's accounting policies (GAAP, cash basis, or modified accrual)
- Reflect operational income and expenses as recorded in the Treasury system
- Used for Member reports, financial statements, and operational decision-making

#### (b) Tax Capital Accounts

Tax Capital Accounts track Member equity for federal income tax purposes:
- Governed by IRC Section 704(b) and Treasury Regulations
- Reflect tax income, deductions, credits, and special allocations
- Used for Schedule K-1 preparation and IRS compliance
- Must satisfy the "substantial economic effect" test under Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)(2)

#### (c) Reconciliation

The Cooperative's accounting system shall maintain a reconciliation between Book and Tax Capital Accounts, including:
- Temporary differences (timing of income/expense recognition)
- Permanent differences (tax-exempt income, nondeductible expenses)
- 704(c) layers for contributed property (Section [Y].3)
- Special allocations (Section [Y].4)

### Section [Y].3 — Section 704(c) Allocations

When a Member contributes property to the Cooperative with a fair market value different from its adjusted tax basis, the Cooperative shall allocate income, gain, loss, and deduction among Members to account for the built-in gain or loss attributable to the contributing Member.

#### (a) Built-In Gain or Loss

**Built-in gain** (or loss) means the difference between:
- The fair market value of contributed property (credited to the contributing Member's Book Capital Account), and
- The adjusted tax basis of the property (carried over to the Cooperative under IRC Section 723)

#### (b) Section 704(c) Method

The Cooperative shall use the **[Traditional Method / Traditional Method with Curative Allocations / Remedial Allocations Method]** to allocate tax items attributable to contributed property, as elected by [governance body].

Under the Traditional Method:
- Tax depreciation, gain, or loss on contributed property is allocated first to the contributing Member to the extent of built-in gain or loss at contribution
- Remaining tax items are allocated based on the Members' economic interests in the property

#### (c) Section 704(c) Layers

The Cooperative's accounting system shall maintain **704(c) Layers** for each property contribution, tracking:
- Contributing Member
- Contribution date
- Book value (fair market value at contribution)
- Tax basis (carryover basis under IRC Section 723)
- Built-in gain or loss (book value minus tax basis)
- Remaining unallocated built-in gain or loss

When property is sold, depreciated, or distributed, the appropriate 704(c) Layer is reduced, and special allocations are made to ensure the contributing Member bears their share of built-in gain or loss.

#### (d) Reverse Section 704(c) Allocations

When the Cooperative revalues property on its books (e.g., upon admission of a new Member), the principles of Section 704(c) shall apply to allocate tax items with respect to the revalued property as if the property had been contributed with built-in gain or loss equal to the difference between book value and tax basis immediately after revaluation.

### Section [Y].4 — Special Allocations

The following special allocations are established to ensure Capital Accounts satisfy IRC Section 704(b) requirements and that allocations have substantial economic effect.

#### (a) Qualified Income Offset (QIO)

If a Member's Capital Account is negative (or would become negative) due to an allocation of loss or deduction, and the Member has no obligation to restore the deficit, the Cooperative shall allocate items of income and gain to that Member in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible.

This allocation is the **Qualified Income Offset** required by Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).

#### (b) Minimum Gain Chargeback

If the Cooperative has **Partnership Minimum Gain** attributable to nonrecourse debt (under Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(d)), and there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during an Accounting Period, each Member shall be allocated items of income and gain for that period equal to their share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain.

This allocation is the **Minimum Gain Chargeback** required by Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(f).

#### (c) Member Minimum Gain Chargeback

If the Cooperative has **Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain** attributable to debt for which a specific Member bears the economic risk of loss (under Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(i)), and there is a net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during an Accounting Period, the Member bearing the risk shall be allocated items of income and gain equal to their share of the net decrease.

This allocation is the **Member Minimum Gain Chargeback** required by Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(i)(4).

#### (d) Nonrecourse Deductions

**Nonrecourse Deductions** (as defined in Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(b)) shall be allocated among Members in proportion to their Weighted Patronage (as defined in [Article X.3]), or as otherwise determined by [governance body] consistent with the Cooperative's economics.

#### (e) Member Nonrecourse Deductions

**Member Nonrecourse Deductions** (as defined in Treasury Regulation 1.704-2(i)) shall be allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss for the debt giving rise to the deductions.

#### (f) Priority of Special Allocations

Special allocations under this Section [Y].4 shall take priority over the general allocation formula in [Article X.4]. To the extent income or gain is allocated under a special allocation, it shall not be included in Allocable Surplus for purposes of the general patronage allocation.

### Section [Y].5 — Deficit Restoration Obligations (DRO)

#### (a) No Unconditional DRO

Unless a Member explicitly agrees otherwise in writing, no Member shall have an unconditional obligation to restore a deficit balance in their Capital Account upon liquidation of the Cooperative or withdrawal from membership.

#### (b) Limited DRO for Specific Liabilities

A Member may agree to a **Limited Deficit Restoration Obligation** to the extent the Member:
- Personally guarantees Cooperative debt
- Receives distributions in excess of their positive Capital Account balance (subject to clawback)
- Otherwise assumes specific liabilities on behalf of the Cooperative

Any Limited DRO shall be documented in a separate written agreement and reflected in the Member's Tax Capital Account calculations.

#### (c) Effect on Loss Allocations

Members without a Deficit Restoration Obligation may not be allocated losses in excess of their positive Capital Account balance, except to the extent permitted by the Qualified Income Offset provisions of Section [Y].4(a).

### Section [Y].6 — Distributions to Members

The Cooperative may make distributions to Members from available cash or property, subject to the following constraints and priorities.

#### (a) Distribution Authority

Distributions shall be authorized by [governance body] based on:
- Cooperative liquidity and cash flow projections
- Capital requirements for ongoing operations and growth
- Debt covenants and lender restrictions (if any)
- Statutory limitations on distributions (Colorado C.R.S. § 7-58-504 or applicable state law)

#### (b) Distribution Types

Distributions may include:
- **Patronage distributions** — cash portion of Patronage Allocations under [Article X.6]
- **Redemption payments** — redemption of retained Patronage Allocations under [Article X.7]
- **Return of capital** — return of a Member's contributed capital
- **Liquidating distributions** — distributions upon dissolution of the Cooperative

#### (c) Priority of Distributions

If the Cooperative lacks sufficient liquidity to make all authorized distributions, distributions shall be prioritized as follows:
1. Statutory or contractual obligations (debt payments, payroll, taxes)
2. Minimum cash patronage distributions required under IRC Section 1385 (20% of current-year Patronage Allocations)
3. Redemption payments to former Members
4. Additional patronage distributions to active Members
5. Return of capital contributions

#### (d) Limitations on Distributions

No distribution shall be made if, after giving effect to the distribution:
- The Cooperative would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business, or
- The Cooperative's total assets would be less than its total liabilities plus (if applicable) amounts needed to satisfy preferential rights of Members upon dissolution

This limitation implements the **Insolvency Test** under Colorado C.R.S. § 7-58-504 or equivalent state law.

#### (e) Tax Withholding

The Cooperative shall withhold federal, state, and local taxes from distributions as required by law, including:
- Backup withholding under IRC Section 3406 (if Member fails to provide TIN)
- State income tax withholding (if applicable)
- Any other withholding obligations imposed by taxing authorities

Withheld amounts shall be treated as distributed to the Member for Capital Account purposes.

### Section [Y].7 — Capital Account Statements

Each Member shall receive a Capital Account statement at least [annually/quarterly] showing:

#### (a) Book Capital Account
- Beginning balance
- Contributions during the period (cash and property)
- Patronage Allocations during the period
- Distributions during the period
- Ending balance

#### (b) Tax Capital Account (Schedule K-1 Basis)
- Beginning balance
- Share of Cooperative ordinary income/loss
- Share of separately stated items (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.)
- Share of tax-exempt income
- Share of nondeductible expenses
- Distributions during the period
- Ending balance
- Basis limitations and at-risk amounts (if applicable)

#### (c) 704(c) Layer Detail
For Members who have contributed property or joined after a book revaluation:
- Description of each 704(c) Layer
- Built-in gain or loss at contribution/revaluation
- Cumulative special allocations to date
- Remaining unallocated built-in gain or loss

### Section [Y].8 — Transfer of Membership Interest and Capital Account

If a Member transfers their membership interest (subject to [Article on transfers]), the transferee shall succeed to the transferor's Capital Account balance, subject to the following:

#### (a) Book Capital Account Transfer
The transferee's Book Capital Account shall equal the transferor's Book Capital Account immediately before the transfer.

#### (b) Tax Capital Account Transfer
The transferee's Tax Capital Account shall equal the transferor's Tax Capital Account immediately before the transfer, adjusted for:
- Any gain or loss recognized by the transferor on the transfer (under IRC Section 741)
- The transferee's basis in the acquired interest (under IRC Section 742)
- Any difference between the amount paid by the transferee and the transferor's Capital Account balance (may create a 704(c) Layer for the transferee)

#### (c) 704(c) Layer Succession
The transferee shall succeed to the transferor's 704(c) Layers, except to the extent eliminated by gain or loss recognized on the transfer.

### Section [Y].9 — Liquidation and Winding Up

Upon dissolution and winding up of the Cooperative, distributions to Members shall be made in accordance with positive Capital Account balances after:
- Payment of Cooperative debts and liabilities to creditors
- Establishment of reserves for contingent liabilities
- Final allocations of gain or loss from sale of Cooperative assets

#### (a) Liquidation Allocations
Gain or loss from sale of Cooperative assets during liquidation shall be allocated to Members in a manner that, to the extent possible, causes Members' Tax Capital Accounts to equal the cash and property they are entitled to receive in liquidation.

#### (b) Liquidation Distributions
After all assets are liquidated and liabilities satisfied, remaining cash and property shall be distributed to Members in proportion to their positive Capital Account balances.

#### (c) Deficit Capital Accounts
If a Member has a deficit Capital Account balance after final allocations, and the Member has no Deficit Restoration Obligation under Section [Y].5, the deficit shall be allocated to other Members with positive Capital Accounts in proportion to their positive balances. This ensures the Cooperative can fully liquidate without requiring Members to contribute additional funds.

### Section [Y].10 — Integration with Habitat Infrastructure

The Cooperative utilizes the **Habitat Treasury System** to maintain Capital Accounts as described in this Article. Habitat provides:

- **Dual-ledger accounting** — separate Book and Tax Capital Account tracking
- **704(c) Layer management** — automated tracking of contributed property built-in gain/loss
- **Special allocation calculations** — QIO, minimum gain chargeback, nonrecourse deductions per Treasury Regulations
- **Event sourcing** — complete audit trail of all Capital Account adjustments
- **Schedule K-1 generation** — automated preparation of IRS Form 1065 Schedule K-1 from Tax Capital Account data
- **Compliance verification** — automated testing of substantial economic effect requirements

Members acknowledge that Habitat's automated Capital Account calculations are authoritative, subject to the amendment procedures in [Article X.8].

## Implementation Notes

This template is designed for **pass-through tax treatment** under IRC Subchapter K (partnerships and LLCs taxed as partnerships). Limited Cooperative Associations may elect partnership tax treatment by default or by filing IRS Form 8832.

### Critical Compliance Points

1. **Substantial Economic Effect** — Capital Account allocations must satisfy the three-part test under Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)(2):
   - Capital Accounts maintained per the regulations
   - Liquidating distributions track Capital Accounts
   - Deficit restoration obligations or qualified income offset provisions are in place

2. **Section 704(c)** — Property contributions require special tracking to ensure built-in gain/loss is allocated to the contributing Member, not spread across all Members.

3. **Nonrecourse Debt** — If the Cooperative has debt for which no Member bears personal liability, minimum gain chargeback and nonrecourse deduction rules apply.

4. **At-Risk and Passive Activity** — Individual Members' ability to deduct allocated losses may be limited by IRC Sections 465 (at-risk) and 469 (passive activity). These are Member-level limitations, not Cooperative-level.

### Customization Variables

When adapting this template:
- **[Y]** = Article/Section numbering in your operating agreement
- **[Article X]** = cross-reference to Patronage Mechanics article (from Sprint 44 template)
- **[governance body]** = Board of Directors, Member Council, etc.
- **[annually/quarterly]** = frequency of Capital Account statements
- **[Traditional Method / ...]** = choice of Section 704(c) allocation method
